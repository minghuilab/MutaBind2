# MutaBind2
## About
<font size=4> 
  
MutaBind2 evaluates the effects of mutations on protein-protein interactions for soluble complexes. It calculates changes in binding affinity upon single or multiple mutations and provides a structural model of mutated complex. The structure of a protein-protein complex is required for this method. MutaBind2 is the second version of MutaBind method. The method can be used for SARS-CoV-2 modeling.
