# MutaBindS
## About
<font size=4> 
  
Before running MutaBindS.py, you need to create a folder including two input files (see sexample). 
  
</font>

## Two input files in the folder of sexample
<font size=4> 

1. The 3D structure of a protein-protein complex (MUTABINDS.pdb), which can be obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) or created by the user.

2. The file containing mutation information (sexample.input), who's name must be consistent with the input folder name.

- PDBfile: coordinate file of a protein-protein complex;
- Partner1: interaction protein 1, one can assign one chain or multiple chains to either Partner 1 or Partner 2 and different chains are connected by dots "." (for example, 'E_1.A_1'). If any protein/chain in the structure has one model, they are depicted with the labels of alphanumeric combinations (for example, ‘E_1’). If any protein/chain in the structure generated by applying symmetry operations has several models, they are described as ‘E_1’,  ‘E_2’...;
- Partner2: interaction protein 2;
- MutChain: the protein chain where the mutation occurs.
- Mutation_PDB: mutations, such as L45P, L is a wild-type amino acid, P is a mutant amino acid, and 45 is the position of the amino acid in MutChain;
- Result_Id: a random number defined by the user.
- isPI: set to 0.

  The columns are separated by tabs.
